# Request Logging Middleware (Day 6 Homework, Module #6, MERN Stack)
![](thumbnail.png)

## Description:
In this assignment, i have developed a Node.js application using Express and implemented [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) middleware for logging details about incoming requests. This middleware will capture essential information such as:
+ the request method,
+ URL, 
+ IP address, and
+ timestamps
thus providing insights about the traffic received by application.

## Key Learning Objectives:
+ Understanding the role of middleware in request processing pipelines.
+ Implementing custom middleware functions to capture and log request details.
+ Utilizing logging libraries like [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) for advanced logging capabilities.
+ Exploring different logging levels (e.g., info, debug) to control the verbosity of logs.
