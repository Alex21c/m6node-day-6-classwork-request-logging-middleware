![](thumbnail.png)

## Description:
In this assignment, i have developed a Node.js application using Express and created a middleware function for logging details about incoming requests. This middleware will capture essential information such as:
+ the request method,
+ URL, 
+ IP address, and
+ timestamps
thus providing insights about the traffic received by application.

## Key Learning Objectives:
+ Understanding the role of middleware in request processing pipelines.
+ Implementing custom middleware functions to capture and log request details.
+ Utilizing logging libraries like [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) for advanced logging capabilities.
+ Exploring different logging levels (e.g., info, debug) to control the verbosity of logs.

## How to install and run in yours local machine
```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Tech. Stack Used:
+ [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
+ [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
